# Handoff

Updated 2026-10-22 UTC. Active work, open acceptance and dated compatibility only; move completed rollout detail to
a dated record and link it here. Rules are in [AGENTS](AGENTS.md); entry points in [README](README.md). Never put
private content, credentials or raw production output here.

Archives (their waiting lists are not instructions): [October 22](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-22.md)
(Tasks UI refinement), [October 21](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-21.md) (the Private
MCP, Boundary B, done steps in Plan, the Tasks PWA features, the FlowDay retirement),
[October 20](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-20.md), [October 19](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-19.md),
[October 18](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-18.md), [October 11](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-11.md).

## Current work

### Approved Tasks interface (`codex/tasks-interface`)

Based on `57a50db5`, isolated in `/private/tmp/todofy-tasks-design`; the shared checkout is untouched.
Implement the owner-selected [visual target](tasks/docs/images/task-interface-approved.png): grouped sidebar,
refined two-column task editor, Execution (Steps/Standalone/Quick) and an independent Routine switch. Manual
active/waiting/onhold/parked fields are removed from the editors, while their persisted values and native
planning rules remain intact. No schema, API, provider, resource or budget changes.

The execution control is shared by native Tasks and Plan's existing editor; mappings stay in their current
owners. Verify saves/no-op saves/etag, timing visibility, date and child controls, category dragging, project
hierarchy and menu access, cached/asynchronous layout and the selected visual target before release. Only
synthetic ephemeral data may be used. Local web lint/typecheck/72 units, shared planning typecheck/324 units,
production build and 44 affected browser cases pass. Real Mac Chrome acceptance and the
[visual comparison](tasks/design-qa.md) pass, including 360 px overflow and Add-composer focus checks.
Branch CI and same-green-SHA production publication remain pending.

## Latest verified release

Tasks UI refinement (`6ef11633`) passed full [branch CI](https://github.com/ziyixi/todofy/actions/runs/39715961056)
and [same-SHA production release](https://github.com/ziyixi/todofy/actions/runs/39716958836). Worker
`a7fbbf96-aacb-4e88-a7d6-1b84674b1c3d` serves that commit at 100%. All 135 browser cases pass, with synthetic
Mac Chrome acceptance for the compact timer and description saving. The [rendered review](tasks/docs/ui-refinement.md)
and [dated evidence](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-22.md) explain the changes and verification limits.

## Open from earlier releases

- Boundary B ([archive](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-21.md#boundary-b-released-claudeboundary-b)): after the
  2026-10-25 Sunday backup, Todofy's health page shows it complete with no `tasks` section. In the next push that
  deploys them anyway, empty `RETIRED_SERVICE_BINDINGS` (Todofy) and reword `proto/buf.yaml`'s header comment, which
  still names the retired `todofy/taskintent/v1` (a change to that file alone deploys every app and the VPS).
- Owner UI, read-only, for Boundary B: Tasks › Mail lists mail and its categories; Plan's weekly review shows the
  pending-mail count; Tasks › GTD shows the copied trend; Mail Hero's 提醒 card names Home's digest task.
- Owner, blocked secret operations: delete todofy-core's Worker secrets `TODOIST_API_KEY`,
  `TODOIST_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`, `TODOIST_OPS_PROJECT_ID` and `TODOIST_REVIEW_PROJECT_ID`, then their optional
  declarations in `todofy/app.toml`, and regenerate (`tools/cloud-config/generate.py`,
  `.github/scripts/drift_desired.py`).
- Set `INFRA_TFVARS` again from the complete private input without the FlowDay names, then empty `RETIRED_VALUES` in
  `infra/scripts/infra_state.py`.
- After 2026-10-25 10:00 UTC, confirm on Todofy's health page that the first Sunday backup after the FlowDay release
  completed.
- Owner: remove the installed FlowDay PWA from each device (optionally, with the owner's OK, its stopped Compose
  service and tunnel rule in `self-host-on-vultr`); by hand on the Mac, the Tasks PWA's Dock menu, a `?task=` link
  opening in the app window, the title-bar toggle, the mini timer and a real lock with Keep and Discard.
- Owner: remove Todoist Plus from `chrome://extensions` (its variable, releases and merged branches are gone).

## Open acceptance

The two scheduler observations the owner stopped on October 17 (email models, website daily sync) are kept
in [the October 18 archive](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-18.md#stopped-scheduler-observations); do not restart them.

### Owner decisions, 2026-10-15

Answered in chat; do not re-ask.

- Recall keeps its seven-day cloud file window. `de4d561` deployed at `2026-10-11T23:55Z`; after about 2026-10-18,
  verify the first production file removal and one Dropbox cold read, recording metadata only, never page content.
- GTD additions: the Waiting list, the weekly review checklist and the Sunday-commit fix. The one-card
  Clarify queue was not chosen, so the checklist only counts the mail project's unplanned tasks and links it.
- Native weekly rollover stays enabled; a commitment for an ended week reads as weekly in Tasks
  ([Tasks design](tasks/docs/design.md), [evidence](docs/tasks-plan-reliability-verification.md)).

### Waiting for the owner

- Mailsort's write limit tripped on 2026-10-21 at 04:00 UTC and it fell back to shadow mode (Home: 待审 6 封).
  The owner decides whether to switch it back to live and whether to raise the per-run limit.
- Install Recall Orion `2026.1015.451` on the phone; renewed phone acceptance follows it.
- Brief's sender `onboarding@resend.dev` delivers only to the Resend account's own address; change it before sending.
- Check the Claude Console workspace spend limit against Brief's stored $80 budget (unverified; $50 was suggested).
- Dedicated Cloudflare tokens for the infra workflows and a fresh deploy token; the infra workflows have not switched
  yet ([replacing the token](infra/README.md#replacing-the-token)).

### Remaining observations and separate follow-ups

- `5134232` removed the direct `vars` expressions from the release composites. Todofy and Home uploaded through them
  in [run 38469896460](https://github.com/ziyixi/todofy/actions/runs/38469896460); the Mail Hero, Brief, Links, Watch,
  Fleet and website-relay composites have not been loaded by a real upload since the `dd7a6e8` refactor. Check the
  first natural release of each; a preflight/no-op does not load the skipped composite.
- Brief still needs archive-day acceptance of source coverage, editorial quality and actual model cost (local checks
  used fakes). Preserve archive mode and $80; sending, shadow mode and Newsletter retirement are separate owner
  decisions, and topic `geo.earth` stays 熟悉. See [Brief design §16](brief/docs/design.md) and [README](brief/README.md).
- Home's account-audit change reporting was deployed at `a3705ed`; confirm a completed daily check shows a qualifying
  dashboard change once as 非 CI 改动
  ([recorded scope](docs/history/handoff-2026-10-11.md#in-flight-2026-10-06-claude-home-reports-account-changes-made-outside-ci)).
- Bootstrap and safe drift repair are verified in the existing environment. Empty-account / clean-VPS setup, DNS and
  host-entry recovery and full historical data recovery remain separate exercises; follow [rebuild](docs/rebuild.md)
  and [its verification table](docs/rebuild-verification.md).
- Not rechecked since: Watch's first real changed-watch digest, Newsletter's natural provider/send acceptance and
  Brief in Home's daily Worker inventory. Check fresh status before treating an old waiting item as open; do not
  restart Compose, replay a send or request credentials solely from an archived note.
- Recall: the cost estimates in [design §5.3](recall/docs/design.md#53-budgets) predate minute snapshots with
  screenshots. The phone still reports build 337, and the `page_probe_invalid_reply_type` cause is not established
  ([diagnostic evidence](docs/recall-diagnostic-verification.md#october-14-recurrence-and-repeated-installation-delay)).

## Operating boundaries

- Workers release independently from committed Wrangler configuration. `config/cloud.toml` is the public deployment
  profile; generated `config/resources.toml` records resource identities. Use the configuration/bootstrap tools and
  `infra/` for their declared resources. Preserve root mail records and unrelated resources.
- GitHub Actions deploys the Newsletter/Platform images by digest through the typed daemon API; it holds no SSH key
  or Kubernetes credential. Legacy Compose services stay stopped with their data; Newsletter remains an independent
  VPS service until the owner retires it.
- Mail Hero backs up natively through its DO Alarm and private R2 ([native backup](mail-hero/docs/native-backup.md)).
  Tasks backs itself up weekly into `tasks-backups` ([Tasks backup](tasks/docs/backup.md)), and Todofy backs up only
  its own D1 (both from release 2 of Boundary B).
- Brief's paid Claude calls can run in archive mode, but email is disabled. The stored $80 budget is distinct from
  the code's initial default and any Claude Console limit; preserve it. Owner-supplied Claude/Resend keys never
  pass through GitHub. Workers Free and existing application budgets remain in force.
- Keep Home's persistent alert dismissal. Historical unknown business outcomes are not automatic replay permission;
  follow current [dashboard-state semantics](docs/dashboard-state.md).

## Dated compatibility and retained data

The authoritative [compatibility table](docs/history.md#owner-api-compatibility) defines the old-client responses:

| Surface | Earliest removal |
| --- | --- |
| Mail Hero legacy owner routes | 2026-11-01 |
| Home and Todofy legacy owner routes | 2026-11-02 |
| Mailsort v1 owner routes | 2026-11-10 |

Keep Todofy core's `owner_api` RPC until the corresponding gateway compatibility window is complete. Dates permit a
reviewed follow-up; they do not schedule deletion or authorise changing frozen webhook bytes or migrations. Todofy's
retained host cutover snapshot stays through **2026-10-29**; deletion is a separate action
([verification](todofy/docs/verification.md)).

## Working and maintenance entry points
